 <p>Humor heals, and kids say the funniest things. I wanted to include some of the lighter memories of Ce with her sisters. When I was almost due, I asked for the girls to write down what they wanted to say to Ce, and here is the list:</p>
 
 <p><strong>Annie:</strong> CeCe you are very special.<br>
 <strong>Annie:</strong> Coming out yet?<br>
 <strong>Annie:</strong> Hioh CeCe, I want to see you soon!<br>
 <strong>Annie:</strong> Happy new year to you, but you're still baking.<br>
 <strong>Annie:</strong> Good or bad, we still love you!<br>
 <strong>Annie:</strong> Knock, knock, anyone in there?<br>
 <strong>Annie:</strong> It's fun to be smart (quoting Brain Quest) but hard to get there.<br>
 <strong>Annie:</strong> Keep God's word in your heart all the time, and follow it too!<br>
 <strong>Annie:</strong> Know yourself and be yourself, don't just follow your friends, make your own decisions.<br>
 <strong>Annie:</strong> You're one of the best sisters and just because of something I say doesn't mean I don't love you.</p>

 <p><strong>Abby:</strong> We waited for a long time for you.<br>
 <strong>Abby:</strong> We wanted to name you, Addison then Acelia.<br>
 <strong>Abby:</strong> Is it toasty inside?<br>
 <strong>Abby:</strong> Hard work to make you and mommy had a C section to get you out.<br>
 <strong>Abby:</strong> We will always like and care for you.<br>
 <strong>Abby:</strong> Study well, catch up, be smart and most important of all is don't have daddy school [especially spelling/vocabulary (vocab for short)].<br>
 <strong>Abby:</strong> You are the one and only Cece, that means you are unique.<br>
 <strong>Abby:</strong> Be the wave, take control of your learning.<br>
 <strong>Abby:</strong> Be wise, make good choices.<br>
 <strong>Abby:</strong> Have good friendship.<br>
 <strong>Abby:</strong> You are a gift not a disaster.</p>
