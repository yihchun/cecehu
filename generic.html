 <p>Dear All,<br><br>
   <i>In Jeremiah 29:11, it is written "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.</i><br><br>
   This was written when the people of God thought all hope was lost, and God reminded them that despite the terrible circumstances, He is still Good. <br><br>
Yih-Chun and I plan to write a series of posts to celebrate Baby Cecelia's life and how our good God is still with us in the midst of pain. I have told several people that somehow, even weeks before the car accident, I had a gentle but persistent feeling that God will take baby Ce early. Coming from a non-charismatic Christian background, it was very strange. However, I still tried to pray my worries away, off and on haggling with the Lord that please don't do this--even up until moments before the accident happened. And when that car hit us, I just, somehow, knew it was time.<br><br>
In the shock of grief, I have screeched at Him that it'd "better be something f*ing amazing" because taking our baby just hurt so bad. Well, while I still don't know what He wants from us, but the lyrics "You give and take away My heart will choose to say Lord, blessed be Your name" (derived from Job 1:21) came to our minds. He does give, but the sovereign Lord also takes away. All I can count on is that He is a GOOD God who means good for His people, and thus, we can still kneel before him and say, "God is Good".</p>

 <p>So we thought to share our journey as we grieve. I'm not a counselor, but I think this would both help us grieve but also draw a sense of community as we collectively grieve. Since, our baby Ce, was just so adorable. And all of us wish we had more time with this squishy baby.<br><br>
