 <p>It took us a few years to want another child. As people imagine, raising kids is not an easy feat. And after having two spirited daughters, Yih-Chun and I debated for many years whether we could handle more. Between two miscarriages, the pandemic, overseas sabbatical, and "old age," Ce came after 8 years of waiting. When I found out that I was pregnant, I was very cautiously excited. Being a medical doctor, I know too much about complications as moms get older. We did end up needing a c-section instead of vaginal birth, but otherwise the pregnancy was difficult but not unusual.<br><br>
   Our baby Ce came on a cold winter day. Cecelia "詩橋" Hu was named in alphabetical order. We've got an "A"nnie and "B"B (Abby), so she was "CC". Her Chinese name was a combination of "poem" and "grace", hoping her life would be filled with God's poetic favor.</p>

 <p>At 6 lb 1oz, she was our biggest baby yet. Looking otherwise almost exactly like her two older sisters at her age, we were all amazed at her full locks of hair. In comparison, the big girls had almost no hair at birth, and they joked that it was because they left all the hair in the womb for Ce.<br><br>
   Baby Ce was mostly a chill baby. Especially as she got older, we were constantly amazed at her level of trust. Most babies continue to cry for a bit after they are picked up, but not Ce. She instantly stops crying and looks up at you. Rarely did she fuss for no reason, and even when she was teased or messed with she generally tolerated it. That is—except when it comes to food. That girl, was particular about her food. I'll share more about her feeding in another post, but she would go from 0 to 60 when her milk is not ready in an instant.</p>
